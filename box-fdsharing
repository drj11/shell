Different processes can share the same fd

Explain why 

CODE
ps u | sort -n -k 6 | { line ; tail -1; }
/CODE

works, but

CODE
ps u | sort -n -k 6 | { head -1 ; tail -1; }
/CODE

does not.


Exercise: Recall that the problem with 'head' above was that it consumed
more of its input than just the 1 line that it required.  'head'
reads it's input in blocks.  Write a program to estimate the block size
used by 'head'.
