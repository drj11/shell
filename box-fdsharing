Different processes can share the same fd

Explain why 

CODE
ps u | sort -n -k 6 | { line ; tail -1; }
/CODE

works, but

CODE
ps u | sort -n -k 6 | { head -1 ; tail -1; }
/CODE

does not.


Exercise 27db90d3: Recall that the problem with 'head' above was that it
consumed more of its input than just the 1 line that it required;
'head' reads its input in blocks.  Write a program to estimate the
block size used by 'head'.
