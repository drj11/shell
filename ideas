Misc

get from my blog the script that RB uses to generate passwords that
ends 'exec foo...', and explain why.

Book Titles:

Shell for the Working Programmer
Modern Shell Programming
Agile Shell Programming
3rd Millenium Shell Programming 

Things we might implement as a practical project for the book:

some sort of server, using netcat
log file parser
twitter client
shell package manager: shark, shrimp
web development framework
buildout/deploy templating system, like puppet.
describe the dependencies between chapters and sideboxes; then use tsort
  to check that the book, as a linear sequence, does not violate any
  dependency.
