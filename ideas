arbornet offer free shell accounts.
telnet to m-net.arbornet.org and login with user newuser and a
blank password.  Cool.

get from my blog the script that RB uses to generate passwords that
ends 'exec foo...', and explain why.

Sparklines in shell: https://github.com/holman/spark
echo *.py versus ls *.py

Heiner Steven has a nice article about signal handling:

Things we might implement as a practical project for the book:

timeout command.
  timeout 10 perl somescript
Monte Carlo Pi method (from the Apple documentation)
railroad syntax diagrams in shell
bignums
some sort of server, using netcat
a thing like pexpect
telnet server
logging module so that shell programs can log
log file parser
twitter client
shell package manager: shark, shrimp
web development framework
buildout/deploy templating system, like puppet.
BDD/TDD test framework.
describe the dependencies between chapters and sideboxes; then use tsort
  to check that the book, as a linear sequence, does not violate any
  dependency. (this would be both a project for the book, and a
  test that the book is "correct")
