Misc

get from my blog the script that RB uses to generate passwords that
ends 'exec foo...', and explain why.

"| sh" versus backtick versus xargs versus "while read a"

Sparklines in shell: https://github.com/holman/spark
echo *.py versus ls *.py

Jonathan Dursi's notes: not bad:
https://github.com/thehackerwithin/PyTrieste/wiki/Lesson1-TheUnixShell
classically scripty.

Awesome history and comparison:

Book Titles:

Portable Shell for the Working Programmer
Modern Shell Programming
Agile Shell Programming
3rd Millenium Shell Programming 

Things we might implement as a practical project for the book:

bignums
some sort of server, using netcat
a thing like pexpect
telnet server
log file parser
twitter client
shell package manager: shark, shrimp
web development framework
buildout/deploy templating system, like puppet.
BDD/TDD test framework.
describe the dependencies between chapters and sideboxes; then use tsort
  to check that the book, as a linear sequence, does not violate any
  dependency. (this would be both a project for the book, and a
  test that the book is "correct")
