In bash but not POSIX
source
(although alias source=. seems to be an entirely adequate
replacement, and works in bash where it is not required)

bash requires that the body of a function definition has braces around
it.  This is good programming style, but is not actually required by
POSIX.

SUS requires that the shell run as a script a file found on the PATH
that is not executable.  bash does not do this.  I was actually quite
surprised to find this in the spec.  Triple check this.

The last command of a pipeline may or may not be executed in a
subshell (bash executes it in a subshell, ksh does not).
