(although alias source=. seems to be an entirely adequate
replacement, and works in bash where it is not required)

bash requires that the body of a function definition is a block
formed with braces or parentheses around it.
This is good programming style, but is not actually required by
POSIX.  dash and ksh accept function definitions without braces.

The last command of a pipeline may or may not be executed in a
subshell (bash and dash execute it in a subshell, ksh does not).

The exit status of a command that received a signal is merely
specified as being bigger than 128.  bash and dash do the
traditional thing of adding 128; but ksh adds 256.

FreeBSD and GNU 'find' differ from spec for -atime,-ctime,-mtime
options.  By one day.
