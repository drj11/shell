(although alias source=. seems to be an entirely adequate
replacement, and works in bash where it is not required)

bash requires that the body of a function definition is a block
formed with braces or parentheses around it.
This is good programming style, but is not actually required by
POSIX.  dash and ksh accept function definitions without braces.

The last command of a pipeline may or may not be executed in a
subshell (bash and dash execute it in a subshell, ksh does not).

The exit status of a command that received a signal is merely
specified as being bigger than 128.  bash and dash do the
traditional thing of adding 128; but ksh adds 256.

The Single Unix Specification Version 2 specified the wrong
behaviour for 'find -atime' etc.  FreeBSD and GNU 'find' follow
the Unix Version 7 behaviour where '-mtime 0' finds files up to
a day old.  It's just possible that there are some Unix systems
that accidentally implemented the SUSv2 behaviour.  Fixed in
SUSv3 and beyond.
