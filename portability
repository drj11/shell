In bash but not POSIX
source

bash requires that the body of a function definition has braces around
it.  This is good programming style, but is not actually required by
POSIX.

SUS requires that the shell run as a script a file found on the PATH
that is not executable.  bash does not do this.  I was actually quite
surprised to find this in the spec.
