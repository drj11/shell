Awesome history and comparison:

Software Carpentry version 4.

[DRAGON]
Aho, Sethi, Ullman, "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and
Tools", Addison-Wesley, 1986. ISBN 0-201-10088-6
(the subsequent edition is probably also worthwhile)

[KORNSHELL]
Morris I. Bolsky, David G. Korn;
"The KornShell Command and Programming Language";
Prentice Hall; 1988; ISBN 0135169720
(the authoritative reference for ksh88 which was a major
inspriration for the POSIX standard.  The subsequent edition is
probably also worthwhile)
