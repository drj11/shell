Which

The well known utility 'which' reveals the location of utilities
on '$PATH'.  It turns out not to be standard.  Of course you can
always use the shell built-in 'type' but its output is not very
reliable, and sometimes the point is to find files on disk
whereas 'type' will say something different for shell built-ins.

We can make a servicable replacement for 'which' in shell
itself.

CODE
{{ 'code-wh.sh' | content | trim }}
/CODE

There are several variants, the wittiest that I could find is:

CODE
{{ 'code-whitty.sh' | content | trim }}
/CODE
