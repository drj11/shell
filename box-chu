Chopping strings.

Shell's string editing facilities are not great, but they can be
useful.  We can use TT ${parm%pattern} TT to repeatedly remove
the end part of some string.  Here I've written a function,
*chu*, that change's directory (like 'cd'), but searches for the
directory in the current directory and in all the ancestors of
the current directory, working up towards the root.

CODE
{{ 'code-chu.sh' | content | trim }}
/CODE

Notice how the iterative call to '_chu' reduces the second
argument by chopping off the final '/*' part.

Aside: htmltopdf ${1%.html}.html ${1%html}.pdf
This allows the first argument to be supplied either with, or
without, the .html extension.
