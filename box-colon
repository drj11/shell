Isn't : just the best command ever?

By the way, in POSIX this is supposed to set the variable:

CODE
a=b :
/CODE

But if you try it in 'bash', then it has no effect, unless POSIX
mode (--posix) in in effect.  It has the specified effect in 'ksh'.
Since 'bash' is popular, but no-one runs 'bash' in POSIX mode,
consider non-portable.
