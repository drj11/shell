When is an option an argument?

What if you've accidentally created a file called '-l' or '-' or something
else that begins with a hypen and you want to remove it, or move it, or
something like that?  (This actually happened to me on my first ever day
of using Unix; I blame that on my somewhat experimental mood).  If you
try «rm -l» then the '-l' will get treated as an option and not an
argument:

PRE
drj$ rm -l
rm: invalid option -- 'l'
Try `rm --help' for more information.
/PRE

You have to trick *rm* into treating '-l' as an argument, not an option.
There are two approaches: Use the '--' option which signals the end of
the options, anything following is therefore an argument; or, call the
file './-l', which does not start with a hypen and is therefore not an
option.

PRE
rm ./-l
rm -- -l
/PRE

Readers might be amused to hear that whilst I was writing this chapter I
accidentally created a file whose name was the 2 bytes that are the
utf-8 representation of the unicode character U+00A0 (NO-BREAK SPACE).
That was quite tricky to remove too.

solutions.
